## ⚙️ Tech Stack

### 🎨 Front-End
- React.js with Tailwind CSS for responsive UI  
- REST API consumption with Axios  
- Document upload, preview, and summary UI  

### 🧠 Back-End
- Node.js with Express.js  
- Handles authentication, document routing, storage, and integration with AI microservice  

### 🧬 AI/NLP Microservice
- Python Flask microservice  
- Uses:
  - **spaCy** for NER and keyword extraction  
  - **HuggingFace Transformers** for summarization (BART, GPT2, DistilBERT models)  
- Receives text via REST API and returns summarized content + insights  

### 🗃️ Database
- MongoDB for storing user data and document metadata  
- Redis for caching processed documents and reducing NLP load  

### 🔐 Auth & Storage
- JWT-based authentication  
- File uploads handled via Express and stored in **local filesystem** (no AWS)

## 📈 Quantifiable Impact

- ⏱️ Reduced document review time by **70%**  
- 📁 Processed **1,000+ documents** with avg. summary time **< 5 seconds**  
- 📊 Improved user retention by **25%** due to intelligent AI insights

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. User uploads a document or pastes text via the frontend (React.js).  
2. The backend (Node.js) stores the file locally and sends the text to the AI Flask microservice.  
3. The Python service runs:
   - Summarization using pretrained HuggingFace models  
   - NER & keyword extraction using spaCy  
4. The response is returned and displayed to the user in the frontend.  
5. Users can **export** or **email** the summary.  
6. MongoDB stores user and document data, and Redis caches previous results for faster processing.
